# Othello Game
This is a Python implementation of the Othello game. It is my first programming project and as such, it is far from perfect. However, the game is complete and fully functional.

# Prerequisites
Before running the game, please make sure that you have installed the following modules:

[pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/)
```
pip install pygame
```

[OS](https://docs.python.org/fr/3/library/os.html)


[sys](https://docs.python.org/fr/3/library/sys.html)


[ast](https://docs.python.org/fr/3/library/ast.html)


[random](https://docs.python.org/fr/3/library/random.html)

[time](https://docs.python.org/fr/3/library/time.html)


# Running the Game
To start the game, simply run "Othello.py".

## Saving and Loading a Game
To save a game, press the "s" key during a game. 

Note that there is only one save slot available, and this feature only works in Player vs Player mode.


To load a saved game, press the "c" key on the main menu. Please note that you cannot load an empty save slot.

## Additional Details
In the main menu, click in the middle of the "Jouer" button to display the game mode selection menu.
